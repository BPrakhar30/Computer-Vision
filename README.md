16-720B Computer Vision

Room DH A302 [Doherty Hall]

Time 11:50AM - 1:10 PM

Units 12

Lecturer Kris Kitani

## Description
This course introduces the fundamental techniques used in computer vision, that is, the analysis of patterns in visual
images to reconstruct and understand the objects and scenes that generated them. Topics covered include image pro-
cessing basics, Hough Transforms, feature detection, feature descriptors, image representations, image classification
and object detection. We will also cover camera geometry, multi-view geometry, stereo, 3D reconstruction from images,
optical flow, motion analysis and tracking.
## Version
Version B of 16-720 is intended for students with prior knowledge of computer vision and prior exposure to machine
learning. Undergraduate students should take 16-385 which is the undergraduate version of the class. Those with no
exposure to computer vision or machine learning should take the A version of the class. Those with advance experience
in computer vision should take the 800 level computer vision courses.
Prerequisites (self evaluation)
Linear Algebra, Multivariate Calculus, Probability theory, Programming
# Grading
Programming Assignments 100% (6 assignments total).
(1) Hough Transform (10%)
(2) Bag of Visual Words (18%)
(3) Neural Networks (18%)
(4) Homography (18%)
(5) 3D Reconstruction (18%)
(6) LK Image Alignment and Tracking (18%)
Grades determined on an absolute scale. Typically 90% and above is A, 80% - 89% is B, 70% - 79% is C, 60% - 69% D,
59% or below is R. There will be extra credit opportunities for students who want to go deeper into the material.
## Homework Submission, Regrades and Allowed Late Days
5 late days for the entire semester. Use up to 2 late days on one assignment. No credit for assignments submitted
after using all late days (to prevent delay of grading). All regrade requests must be made within 2 weeks of the
deadline. Additional late day can be granted for factors outside of your control (e.g., medical emergencies, sudden family
emergencies, multiple overlapping assignment deadlines) but will not be granted for planned activities (e.g., conference
deadlines, vacation travel).
## Educational Outcomes
(1) Implement the Hough Transform to detect lines in an image
(2) Extract SIFT features to build a Bag-of-Words representation of an image for classification
(3) Perform object recognition using a convolutional neural network
(4) Detect Harris Corners and implement the RANSAC algorithm to find the homography between two images
(5) Perform 3D reconstruction and stereo rectification to implement stereo block matching using two images
(6) Implement a gradient descent based image alignment algorithm to track objects in a video
(7) Students will learn how to use Python and PyTorch through the programming assignments
## Academic Integrity
All encouraged to work together BUT you must do your own work (code and write up). If you work with someone,
please include their name in your write up and inside any code that has been discussed. If we find highly identical
write-ups or code without proper accreditation of collaborators, we will take action according to university policies. If
you use someoneâ€™s material, please given them credit by including a citation where necessary.

## Take Care of Yourself
Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting
enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress. All of us benefit
from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and
an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than
later is often helpful. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like
anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is
here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching
out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.
