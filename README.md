16-720B Computer Vision

Room DH A302 [Doherty Hall]

Time 11:50AM - 1:10 PM

Units 12

Lecturer Kris Kitani

## Description
This course introduces the fundamental techniques used in computer vision, that is, the analysis of patterns in visual
images to reconstruct and understand the objects and scenes that generated them. Topics covered include image pro-
cessing basics, Hough Transforms, feature detection, feature descriptors, image representations, image classification
and object detection. We will also cover camera geometry, multi-view geometry, stereo, 3D reconstruction from images,
optical flow, motion analysis and tracking.
## Version
Version B of 16-720 is intended for students with prior knowledge of computer vision and prior exposure to machine
learning. Undergraduate students should take 16-385 which is the undergraduate version of the class. Those with no
exposure to computer vision or machine learning should take the A version of the class. Those with advance experience
in computer vision should take the 800 level computer vision courses.
Prerequisites (self evaluation)
Linear Algebra, Multivariate Calculus, Probability theory, Programming
## Educational Outcomes
(1) Implement the Hough Transform to detect lines in an image
(2) Extract SIFT features to build a Bag-of-Words representation of an image for classification
(3) Perform object recognition using a convolutional neural network
(4) Detect Harris Corners and implement the RANSAC algorithm to find the homography between two images
(5) Perform 3D reconstruction and stereo rectification to implement stereo block matching using two images
(6) Implement a gradient descent based image alignment algorithm to track objects in a video
(7) Students will learn how to use Python and PyTorch through the programming assignments
