# Computer-Vision

## Project Outcomes
(1) Implementing the Hough Transform to detect lines in an image

(2) Extracting SIFT features to build a Bag-of-Words representation of an image for classification

(3) Performing object recognition using a convolutional neural network

(4) Detecting Harris Corners and implementing the RANSAC algorithm to find the homography between two images

(5) Performing 3D reconstruction and stereo rectification to implement stereo block matching using two images

(6) Implementing a gradient descent based image alignment algorithm to track objects in a video
