## Project Outcomes
(1) Implement the Hough Transform to detect lines in an image

(2) Extract SIFT features to build a Bag-of-Words representation of an image for classification

(3) Perform object recognition using a convolutional neural network

(4) Detect Harris Corners and implement the RANSAC algorithm to find the homography between two images

(5) Perform 3D reconstruction and stereo rectification to implement stereo block matching using two images

(6) Implement a gradient descent based image alignment algorithm to track objects in a video

(7) Students will learn how to use Python and PyTorch through the programming assignments
